# All Countries and Codes
All countries and their codes are written in many language for developer to help not searching any more. You can find arrays and objects for your language. If not available for your language, just request!

## Introduction
> Why did I prepare this repo? Because I didn't find any code helper for countries and I needed it. Then I prepared an array to use country list in register page, a few weeks later, I again needed that array but that time not for js, for PHP. So I decided to prepare arrays and objects for all major languages.


## Languages already written
- HTML (Select)
- JS (Array & Object)
